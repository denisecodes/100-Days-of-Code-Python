        Tech used: Python<br>
        This is a group project completed for Code First Girls Kickstarter Python course. The aim of this project is to
        help users find recipes to cook based on certain parameters: meal type, cuisine type and ingredient. For this
        code, we are using a recipe API to retrieve recipes.
